27/5/2025 - set up the repo for the hunt the wumpus project.
Spent some time learning about the original 1973 game.
Created the cave class document and wrote the first attributes (name and decription).
30/5/2025 - Write the main.py program to call the class and make the first cave object.
Modified the attributes to set up name on initialisation
Wrote setter and getter methods for each attributes. Started planning the layout of the caves.
2/6/2025 - Wrote a dictionary attribute to store the links to other cave
Wrote and tested a method to print the linked_caves dictionary to the terminal.
3/6/2025 - Added code to the main program to allow the player to move between different cave objects.
Set up a new Character class and test program.
Created 'joyboy - The smelly Wumpus' in the test program and tested the conversation method.
 4/6/2025 - Set up enemy sub-class from character class. 
 Also added enemey weakness by introducing "combat_item" to "Joyboy" the enemy with "touching grass".
Wrote a method for fight() that overrides the fight() method in the super-class
Updated the char_text code to test the new sub-class objects (particularly the weakness and fight_methods)
6/6/2025 - Finishes testing the character in the char.test.py file. Added Joyboy obbject to the main program 
and added it to the dunngeon object. Reworked the main loop to accept different inputs (moving, talking and fighting)
- still need to finish the code to manage fighting.
10/6/2025 - Completed the tutorial for Hunt The Wumpus. Started to make more ideas to continue on with the project.
13/6/2025 - Came up with Idea to make the Game Terraria for the map of the game. The first idea of an Among us shaped map did
not go well. not one bit...
16/6/2025 - Continued working on my Terraria map, argueing with myself whether the level system or an open world with no restrictions. You level up when you travel through each level
- The order of each level is forest, jungle, hallowed, and corruption.
- started to change "cave" and "caverns" to "area" and "areas" to fit my terraria scenery. Messed up hard, I think. 
17/6/2025 - Fixed the problem of changing cave/cavern to area/areas by deleting 'name', changing from 'def __init__name():' to 'def __init__():
- Don't know how/why name was There
- Continued planning the map and scenery; adding more areas to each biome, adding a Wise Hermit, asks you to choose 2 golden chests from "West" and "South".
- West chest tranforms into golden chest mimic when chosen
- South chest grants you to upgrade your iron sword to golden
- Colour coded the areas according to their biome (except spawn: brown) 
18/6/2025 - continued expanding my map in excel
- Started putting the areas into my codespace
